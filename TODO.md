Scattered TODOs that either don't belong in any particular application, or that I was just too lazy to place there:

- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Configure HTTPS with TLS certificates for ArgoCD, Authentik, and Immich (use cert-manager with existing ClusterIssuer) - currently using insecureSkipVerify workaround
- [ ] Try updating Sonarr (if the issue noted in `values.yaml` has been resolved)
- [X] Move Readarr config onto `iscsi` (NFS seems not to play nice with SQLite), then use [rreading-glasses](https://github.com/blampe/rreading-glasses#usage)
- [ ] MySQL database for Ombi
- [X] Correct the names back from "Overseerr" to "Ombi" - turns out I forgot to swap the images in the first place!
- [ ] Integrate Vault with Kubernetes secrets using Vault Secrets Operator (see [docs/todo/vault-to-k8s-secrets.md](docs/todo/vault-to-k8s-secrets.md))
- [ ] Consider switching from VSO to ESO if multi-backend support becomes needed (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP, etc.) - see [docs/todo/eso-vs-vso-comparison.md](docs/todo/eso-vs-vso-comparison.md)
- [X] Complete Telegram alerting setup: create bot, get chat ID, create `alertmanager-telegram` secret (see [manifests/alertmanager-telegram/README.md](manifests/alertmanager-telegram/README.md))
- [ ] Investigate rasnu1 Pi - Tailscale offline (34+ days), DNS broken due to Tailscale resolver configured but not connected. Node cordoned. Check power supply, SD card, `dmesg` for under-voltage warnings, and fix Tailscale connectivity
- [ ] Unseal Vault after restart (`kubectl exec -n vault vault-0 -- vault operator unseal`)
- [ ] Merge `homelab-hardening` branch after confirming monitoring works (health checks, resource limits, deprecated API cleanup, image pinning)
- [X] Install NVIDIA k8s-device-plugin for GPU-accelerated Jellyfin transcoding (see https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin)
- [ ] Set up Renovate for automated dependency updates (see https://docs.renovatebot.com/ - consider GitHub App for simplicity or self-hosted CronJob for full control)
- [~] Set up SSO via Authentik (ArgoCD done, Jellyfin/Grafana/others pending)
- [ ] Fully backup and test k3s HA Postgres cluster
- [ ] Configure CloudNative-PG scheduled backups to S3/MinIO for Immich and Authentik databases
- [ ] Migrate standalone PostgreSQL apps (Ombi?) to CloudNative-PG
- [ ] Investigate storing democratic-csi Helm values partially in git (non-secret config) with secrets injected separately (Vault, sealed-secrets, or Helm --set flags)
- [X] Auto-purge Cloudflare cache after publishing a new blog entry (ArgoCD PostSync hook in blog-deployment repo)
- [ ] Implement selective Cloudflare cache purging (purge only changed URLs instead of everything)
- [ ] Investigate network-booting the Pis (to avoid SD card failures and simplify node rebuilds)
