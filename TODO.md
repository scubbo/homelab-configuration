Scattered TODOs that either don't belong in any particular application, or that I was just too lazy to place there:

- [ ] Try updating Sonarr (if the issue noted in `values.yaml` has been resolved)
- [X] Move Readarr config onto `iscsi` (NFS seems not to play nice with SQLite), then use [rreading-glasses](https://github.com/blampe/rreading-glasses#usage)
- [ ] MySQL database for Ombi
- [X] Correct the names back from "Overseerr" to "Ombi" - turns out I forgot to swap the images in the first place!
